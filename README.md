# fossee-task1
in this i have completed first task for fossee internship

1. What design principles guided your improvements?

i tried to make it favourable for mobiles as well because most the students usually open these websites on phones to make user experience more good i focused on working of website on mobiles.

2. How did you ensure responsiveness across devices?

i have used tailwind css which makes the website more efficient. for example is a person open website on laptop it will open in wide screen properly but in case of mobile it will open vertically and give a better experience to user.

3. What trade-offs did you make between design and performance?

The main trade-off was using online resources (like Google Fonts and Tailwind CSS) to make it look great quickly.

4. What was the most challenging part of the task and how did you approach it?

firstly to understand the whole file first and locate out the problem in ui, that was simple so i make it more efficient ui/ux. secondly the personal problem i faced is time managment.
